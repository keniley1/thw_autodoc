    "\"The application programming interface (API) is the definition of the protocol that two pieces of code may use to interact with one another.\" [[THW Berkeley]](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/berkeley/blob/master/code_examples/documentation/documentation.ipynb). For functions, the number of inputs and the values they return constitute the API. But this idea can be taken further! Python in particular allows a user to define **docstrings**. A docstring is an unassigned string literal that is placed after a function declaration *before other operations in the body*. It can be used to briefly explain the purpose of the function, list input/output formats, and give examples of usage. "

However, when comments and dosctrings are properly constructed they become even more powerful with the use of **automation**, which essentially scrapes the comments and docstrings from your code and generates interactive documentation. There are packages available for most (all?) languages.

    "\n",
    "Sphinx is included in most basic Python installations (Anaconda, Canopy). To illustrate its usage, a simple module 'test_functions' is included on this git repository (src/ directory) along with its documentation! Both the square_root() and mean_val() functions are included in the module. (Note that this is not a good module; there is no __init__ routine, for example!)\n",

    "\n",
    "API documentation is also available (also shamelessly stolen, this time from a [previous THW discussion](https://github.com/thehackerwithin/illinois/blob/master/sphinx/sphinx.pdf)): \n",
    "\n",
    "``` bash\n",
    "sphinx-apidoc -A \"MyName\" -F -o docs src/\n",

    "* .rst files - holds user guides or theory manual content\n",
    "* Makefile - used to build .html or .pdf documentation files!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quickstart\n",
    "\n",
    "If you run quickstart, you will be prompted with a series of questions to initialize your project documentation. Be sure to select \"yes\" for both the autodoc and Makefile suggestions. If you select **yes** to the option to have the source and build files in separate directories, your project structure will look something like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Several edits will need to be made to the source files: \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the proper directory is simply '../../src'.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Create an .rst file for your module\n",
    "For the purposes of this \"project\", I've named the \"module\" test_functions. The test_functions.rst file will look like this:\n",
